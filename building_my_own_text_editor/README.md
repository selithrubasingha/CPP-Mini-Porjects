# Kilo: Text Editor From Scratch in C

A lightweight, terminal-based text editor built from the ground up in C. This project was an exercise in understanding low-level systems programming, memory management, and how command-line tools interact directly with the terminal interface without relying on heavy external libraries like `ncurses`.

## 🚀 Features

* **Syntax Highlighting:** Custom color support for C/C++ (comments, keywords, strings).
* **Search Functionality:** Incremental search with `Ctrl+F`.
* **File Operations:** Open, edit, and save files to disk.
* **Raw Mode:** Custom terminal configuration to handle keypresses directly.
* **Navigation:** Full support for Arrow keys, `Page Up/Down`, `Home`, and `End`.
* **Smart Rendering:** Handles scrolling and dynamic window resizing.

## 🧠 What I Learned & Mastered

Building a text editor is one of the most effective ways to master the C language. This project moved beyond basic syntax into complex memory manipulation and terminal control.

### 1. Advanced C & Memory Management
* **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Gained a fundamental understanding of heap allocation using `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.
* **Manual Data Management:** Learned to manually manage dynamic arrays (buffers) for rows of text, ensuring no memory leaks occur when lines are modified or deleted.
* **Standard Library Mastery:** Utilized specific memory functions like `memmove` (for efficient character insertion/deletion) and `memcpy` to manipulate raw bytes of data safely.

### 2. Terminal Control & ASCII
* **Raw vs. Canonical Mode:** Learned how to disable the terminal's default processing (canonical mode) to process input byte-by-byte.
* **Escape Sequences:** Mastered VT100 escape codes (starting with `\x1b`) to control cursor positioning, clear the screen, and change text colors.
* **Control Characters:** Gained a deep understanding of ASCII beyond standard letters—mapping hidden keys like `Ctrl+Q` (Quit), `Ctrl+S` (Save), and parsing multi-byte sequences for Arrow keys, `Page Up`, and `Page Down`.

### 3. Editor Mechanics & Algorithms
* **Data Structures:** Modeled text as a structure of rows (`erow`), separating the "file content" (what is saved) from the "render content" (what is displayed, handling tabs vs. spaces).
* **Search Implementation:** Built a linear search function that scans the row buffers, demonstrating practical array manipulation.
* **Syntax Highlighting Logic:** implemented a state-machine parser that processes text character-by-character to identify comments, strings, and keywords, maintaining state across multiple lines.

## 🛠️ How to Build & Run


### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) & macOS
You can compile using `make` or manually with `gcc`.

**Option 1: Using Make:**
```bash
make 
```

**Option 2: Manual Compilation**

```Bash

gcc kilo.c -o kilo -Wall -Wextra -std=gnu99
```
**Run the editor:**

```Bash

./kilo [filename]
```

### Windows Users ⚠️

This project uses POSIX-specific libraries (<termios.h>) for terminal control, which are __not available natively on Windows.__

To run this on Windows, you must use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):

1. Open your WSL terminal (e.g., "Ubuntu on Windows").

2. Navigate to the project folder.

3. Run the make or gcc commands listed above.

__Technical Note:__

This editor relies on the POSIX standard for raw mode terminal control. It will not compile with MinGW or native Windows compilers because they lack the termios struct required for low-level TTY manipulation.
